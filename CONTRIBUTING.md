## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Standards

#### C# Coding Conventions
```csharp
// Use PascalCase for public members
public class WindowManager
{
    // Use camelCase for private fields with underscore prefix
    private readonly string _windowTitle;
    
    // Use PascalCase for properties
    public string WindowTitle { get; set; }
    
    // Use PascalCase for methods
    public void MinimizeWindow()
    {
        // Use camelCase for local variables
        var windowHandle = GetWindowHandle();
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`WindowManager`, `SearchForm`)
- **Methods**: PascalCase (`GetWindowList`, `UpdateUI`)
- **Properties**: PascalCase (`WindowTitle`, `IsVisible`)
- **Fields**: camelCase with underscore prefix (`_windowHandle`, `_isInitialized`)
- **Constants**: PascalCase (`MaxWindowCount`, `DefaultTimeout`)
- **Local Variables**: camelCase (`windowList`, `searchText`)

#### Code Organization
- **One class per file** (except for small helper classes)
- **Group related functionality** in the same namespace
- **Use regions sparingly** and only for large files
- **Order members**: Fields, Properties, Constructor, Methods
- **Keep methods focused** and single-purpose

### Documentation Standards

#### XML Documentation Comments
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Retrieves a list of all visible windows on the desktop.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="includeMinimized">Whether to include minimized windows in the result.</param>
/// <returns>A list of window information objects.</returns>
/// <exception cref="UnauthorizedAccessException">Thrown when insufficient permissions.</exception>
public List<WindowInfo> GetVisibleWindows(bool includeMinimized = false)
{
    // Implementation...
}
```

#### Code Comments
- **Explain WHY, not WHAT**: Focus on reasoning rather than obvious operations
- **Document complex algorithms**: Especially Windows API interactions
- **Note important limitations**: Performance considerations, OS version requirements
- **Reference sources**: Link to documentation for complex Win32 API calls

### Testing Guidelines

#### Manual Testing
- **Test on Multiple Windows Versions**: Windows 10 and 11
- **Test Different DPI Settings**: 100%, 125%, 150%, 200%
- **Test Multiple Monitors**: Verify multi-monitor scenarios
- **Test Edge Cases**: Empty window lists, permission issues, etc.

#### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows established conventions
- [ ] No obvious performance issues
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] UI changes are responsive and accessible
- [ ] Windows API calls are used correctly
- [ ] Memory management is proper (dispose patterns)
- [ ] Thread safety is considered for UI operations

## üîÑ Git Workflow

### Branch Naming
- **Features**: `feature/description` (e.g., `feature/search-improvements`)
- **Bug Fixes**: `bugfix/description` (e.g., `bugfix/hotkey-registration`)
- **Documentation**: `docs/description` (e.g., `docs/api-documentation`)
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/description` (e.g., `refactor/window-manager`)

### Commit Messages
Follow the conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Examples:**
```
feat(search): add fuzzy search algorithm
fix(hotkeys): resolve hotkey registration on Windows 11
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(ui): extract window list component
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Pull Request Guidelines

#### PR Title
Use the same format as commit messages:
```
feat(search): implement advanced window filtering
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Sensitive Operations
WController performs several operations that require careful consideration:
- **Window manipulation**: Affecting other applications
- **Hotkey registration**: Global system hooks
- **Process enumeration**: Accessing information about running processes
- **File system access**: Indexing files and directories

### Security Guidelines
- **Validate all inputs**: Especially file paths and window handles
- **Handle permissions gracefully**: Provide clear error messages for access issues
- **Minimize privileges**: Request only necessary permissions
- **Sanitize data**: Prevent injection attacks in file operations

## üìû Getting Help

### Communication Channels
